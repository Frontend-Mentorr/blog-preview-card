## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.illustrationBox {
  border-radius: 10px;
  background-image: url(../assets/images/illustration-article.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  width: 100%;
  height: 42%;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
  position: relative;
  background-color: blue;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

h1:hover {
  background: black;
  color: var(--color-yellow);
  text-decoration: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
